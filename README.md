## Nice to meet ya! Zochrab Blume's the name!
Hello! I'm a student at 42Berlin, currently working on various programming projects, mostly focused on C. My work includes building and contributing to projects like **minishell** (a custom shell), **philosophers** (a simulation based on the dining philosophers problem), and **various algorithm challenges** for my studies.

## About Me
- I'm a passionate programmer and a student at **42Berlin**, where I'm learning software development with a focus on algorithms and systems programming.
- I mostly write in **C** but enjoy working on challenges that require deep problem-solving skills.
- Check out my projects to see what I'm working on and learning along the way.

## Projects
Here are a few of my recent projects:

- **Minishell**: A custom shell implementation reminiscent of bash, to understand how shells work under the hood.
- **Philosophers**: A simultion of the dining philosophers problem, focusing on concurrency and multithreading.

## Skills
- C Programming
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Problem Solving
- Multi-threading and Concurrency
- Makefiles and Git

Feel free to explore my repositories, mayhaps it gives you âœ¨inspirationâœ¨!

Thanks for visiting!
